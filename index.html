        <h1>Wordle Rules and Guidelines</h1>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>The objective of Wordle is to guess a secret five-letter word chosen by the game. This word is typically a common English word found in standard dictionaries.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You have six attempts to guess the secret word.</li>
                <li>Each guess must be a valid five-letter English word.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Feedback Mechanism</h2>
            <p>After each guess, the game provides feedback in the form of colored squares:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A green square indicates that a letter in your guess is correct and in the correct position.</li>
                <li>A yellow square indicates that a letter in your guess is correct but in the wrong position.</li>
                <li>A gray square indicates that a letter in your guess is not present in the secret word.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Strategy</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the feedback from previous guesses to eliminate possible words and make educated guesses.</li>
                <li>Start with words that include common letters in English words.</li>
                <li>Pay attention to the positions of correct letters to narrow down possibilities.</li>
                <li>Avoid guessing proper nouns, hyphenated words, or abbreviations, as these are typically not allowed.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Winning</h2>
            <p>If you guess the secret word correctly within six attempts, you win the game.</p>
            <p>Winning Wordle requires a combination of deduction, vocabulary, and strategy. Each successful guess brings you closer to identifying the secret word.</p>
        </div>
